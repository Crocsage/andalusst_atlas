# Andalusst Atlas

The Andalusst is a Django powered website to help members of the storytelling group [PMD Unity](http://pmdunity.deviantart.com/) track their teams and group content.

## Installation

Running a local copy requires an installation of Django and a compatible database backend.

Additionally, sprites and official artwork of Pok√©mon used on the site can be pulled from [pokedex-media](http://git.veekun.com/pokedex-media.git).

Before running a copy of the site, you'll need to create a pmdu/settings.py and pmdu/user_settings.py files with appropriate values. Examples of these files are included.
